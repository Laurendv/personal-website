            <p>
                29 yo from France, Germany & Vietnam, currently living in ðŸŒž Portugal.

            <p>
                I like to surf, code, marketing, read (learn about new things), travel, fight (mainly brazilian jiujitsu), minimalism, philosophy and the markets. I am intrinsically curious.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since 2017, I have been exploring different business ideas, and previously worked in sales at Microsoft, Sage & SAP.
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded Trantor Ventures and Cleon1. You might have guessed, I am a big sci-fi fan :)
            </p>
            <p>
                In the day and age where many writersâ€™ only goals are to:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>trigger cheap dopamine</li>
                <li>rank on search engine results pages</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I aim to bring value, and share details on ideas I explore.
